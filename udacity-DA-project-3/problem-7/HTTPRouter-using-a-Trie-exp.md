Similar to problem 5 instead we're working with paths instead of simply atrings.
Time complexity within the trie for searching and inserting is going to be determined
by the lenght of the path we're searching/inserting which gives us a run time of O(n).
For the space complexity we would have a worst case of O(n), where there would be no
shared paths.
