I knew that I was going to first need to sort these numbers since the pattern seemed
to be just start with the largest number which would be first in the list and then 
arrange the numbers every other to form the largest numbers possible. Since the time complexity
of O(nlog(n)) is the target the first thing I thought of was merge sort, just organize the 
numbers in decending order. Since we're rearranging the input array the space complexity is
going to be O(n) and dependant on the length of the input array.
