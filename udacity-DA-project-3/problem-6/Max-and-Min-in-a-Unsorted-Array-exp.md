Similar to problem 4 in that we are trying to accomplish this task we can use a Linear search algorithm
to accomplish this task where we traverse the array from first to last index keeping track of current min
and max values updating the min max as we go which returns a tuple of the min max with a single
pass in O(n) time complexity. Since were doing this Linear search in place the space complexity of this problem 
will take O(1)
