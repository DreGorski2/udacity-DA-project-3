Given the condition that this need to be a single traversal and run in O(n)
I chose to do quick sort setting the pivot at 1 and determining if the number is 
higher or lower then this pivot which allows us to traverse the list only once sorting the values in place.
since we're sorting the original array the space complexity will be O(n) and depcnded on size
of the input array
